# Introduction:
TAPS INC brings you Middle Point. This app is designed to help people find the middle point to meet, between two locations.
# How it works: 
The user is presented with a landing page which gives them a snapshot and a brief description of the application. Once the user presses 'Start here', the user is taken to the home screen.
Once at the homepage, the user is prompted with a pop up box whoch asks the user to 'allow' or 'block'their location. Allowing the loaction enables the appllication to generate the responce and find the middle point. On the page there is an address field for the user to enter and an input box for the user to enter what sort of place they are looking for. Once they press submit the user will be presented with all of the options. 
# Results:
The app produces an efficient and effective way to provide the user with a central meeting place, with options for the type of place the user is looking for. The map appears with pinned locations, along with the list of places.
